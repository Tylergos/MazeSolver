# MazeSolver
A maze solving program based on A* pathfinding. Mazes are stored in .txt files, with 'S's representing the start, '#'s representing walls, 'E's for the end, 'O' for the current position, 'o's for cells being looked at, '.'s for cells explored, 'X' for when the end is reached, ' 's for open unvisited cells, and '@'s for the shortest path from start to end.
